# Introduction

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments.It helps to find different groups in an image such that pixels in the same cluster/segment share 
certain characteristics. Image segmentation has wide range of applications like segmenting Satellite imagery, Medical Imaging images etc.

K-means algorithm is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that classifies the input data points into multiple classes based on their inherent distance from each other. The algorithm assumes that the data features form a vector space and tries to find natural clustering in them.

User needs to specify the path of image, number of clusters we want the image to be classified into.
